🚀 Project Highlight: Building a Decision Tree Classifier with the Bank Marketing Dataset 📊

Recently, I worked on a machine learning project using the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The task was to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

🔍 Steps involved:

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, visualize trends, and clean data.
Used Label Encoding to handle categorical variables.
Split the dataset into training and test sets for model evaluation.
Built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer purchase behavior.
Evaluated the model performance with accuracy and classification reports.
The project improved my understanding of working with real-world data, especially handling categorical features and building decision tree models.

💡 Technologies used: Python, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib.

Looking forward to applying these skills to future machine learning projects!
